Feature: Restore deleted files/folders
  As a user
  I would like to restore files/folders
  So that I can recover accidentally deleted files/folders in ownCloud

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"
    And as the administrator

  Scenario Outline: deleting a file in a received folder when restored it comes back to the original path
    Given using <dav-path> DAV path
    And these users have been created with default attributes and skeleton files:
      | username |
      | user0    |
      | user1    |
    And user "user0" has created folder "/shared"
    And user "user0" has moved file "/textfile0.txt" to "/shared/shared_file.txt"
    And user "user0" has shared folder "/shared" with user "user1"
    And user "user1" has moved file "/shared" to "/renamed_shared"
    And user "user1" has deleted file "/renamed_shared/shared_file.txt"
    And user "user1" has logged in to a web-style session
    When user "user1" restores the file with original path "/renamed_shared/shared_file.txt" using the trashbin API
    Then as "user1" the file with original path "/renamed_shared/shared_file.txt" should not exist in trash
    And user "user1" should see the following elements
      | /renamed_shared/                |
      | /renamed_shared/shared_file.txt |
    Examples:
      | dav-path |
      | old      |
      | new      |
