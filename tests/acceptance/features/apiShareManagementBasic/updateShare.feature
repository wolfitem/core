  Scenario Outline: Allow modification of reshare
    Given using OCS API version "<ocs_api_version>"
    And these users have been created with default attributes and without skeleton files:
      | username |
      | user1    |
      | user2    |
    And user "user0" has created folder "/TMP"
    And user "user0" has shared folder "TMP" with user "user1"
    And user "user1" has shared folder "TMP" with user "user2"
    When user "user1" updates the last share using the sharing API with
      | permissions | 1 |
    Then the OCS status code should be "<ocs_status_code>"
    And user "user2" should not be able to upload file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "TMP/textfile.txt"
    And user "user1" should be able to upload file "filesForUpload/textfile.txt" to "TMP/textfile.txt"
    Examples:
      | ocs_api_version | ocs_status_code |
      | 1               | 100             |
